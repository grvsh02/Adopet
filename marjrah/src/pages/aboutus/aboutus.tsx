                                We, the team of AdoPet, are a group of people working towards the betterment of the untended animals on the streets through our technological innovations. We do this by arranging adoption awareness on our platform. These adoption awareness invites rescuers from all over the city to bring their rescued animals or and be able to meet with so many potential adopting families. All the funds that we collect as donations, go towards resources of the these voiceless creatures

                                So far, we have successfully organized more than 20 adoption camps and have seen more than 400 rescued animals starting a new and better life with their forever families.
                                We aim to make the world a better place for animals by making them a part of our lives. We are a team of 4 people who are working towards this goal.
